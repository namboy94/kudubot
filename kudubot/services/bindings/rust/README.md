# Rust kudubot bindings

These are binding/helper functions for writing an external
[kudubot](https://gitlab.namibsun.net/namboy94/kudubot)
Service.

To integrate the bindings in your project, add the following
line to the `[dependencies]` section of your `Cargo.toml`
file:

    kudubot-bindings = "VERSION"
    
Replace Version with the version of your choice, or just `*` for the
newest version.

For an instruction on how to write Services in Rust, have a look at
