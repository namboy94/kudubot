## Coding guidelines

**Unit Testing**

Code should be unit tested with a near-100% coverage. This may not always be completely
feasible, but at least 90%+ should be targeted. However, Unit tests should not just be
done to achieve a high test coverage, writing useful tests is even more important,
just not as easily measurable.

**Style**

We feel that a unified coding style is important, which is why we require a linter to
be used. In this case **pep8** is used. Code must pass pep8's tests, with the exception that
we allow up to 120 characters per line instead of the default 80.

**Documentation**

We use sphinx-autodoc to create automated documentation from docstring comments. As a result, all
classes, methods and class/instance variables should be described using docstring comments.

Hard to understand parts of code within a method should always be commented
accordingly.
